# color-vocab
Welcome to my "Color Vocab" project! I'm excited to share with you this simple and interactive HTML/CSS project that helps you learn the colors in Japanese. In this project, I've utilized basic CSS principles, including element, class, and ID selectors, to represent Japanese color vocabulary through colorful visuals.

## Project Overview

- **Title**: Color Vocab
- **Objective**: Learn the colors in Japanese!

### HTML Structure

- **`<h1>`: Colors** - This heading introduces the project and sets the stage for learning.
- **`<h2>`: Learn the colors in Japanese!** - This subheading provides a clear goal for the project.
- **`<h2>` with class `color-text` and ID attributes for Each Color**
  - These headings display the Japanese color names.
  - Example: `<h2 class="color-text" id="red">Aka</h2>`

### Visuals

- **Images**: Colorful images representing each color are displayed alongside the Japanese color names.
- Example: `<img src="./assets/images/red.png" alt="red image">`

## CSS Styling

- **External Stylesheet**: The project uses an external CSS stylesheet named "style.css" for styling.
- **Element, Class, and ID Selectors**: CSS element, class, ID selectors are employed to style elements with different colors and fonts.
- Example: `.img { width: 200px; height: 200px}`, `.color-text { color: blue; }`, `#red { color: red; }`

## Usage

Feel free to explore the project. Highlight each color to learn the corresponding Japanese name. This project is not only a great way to learn Japanese colors but also serves as an example of using HTML and CSS to create an learning experience.

Enjoy exploring the colors and their Japanese names!
